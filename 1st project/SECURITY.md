# Security Audit Report - SheetWise Data Analytics Platform

##  Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. Environment Variables Security
**Issue**: Weak default JWT secret and hardcoded credentials
**Resolution**: 
- Updated .env with secure placeholder values
- Created .env.example template
- Added environment variable documentation

### 2. Hardcoded Admin Password
**Issue**: Admin seed script contained hardcoded password 
**Resolution**:
- Made admin password configurable via ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable
- Added secure default fallback password
- Updated documentation

### 3. Sensitive Data in Documentation
**Issue**: README contained example JWT secret
**Resolution**:
- Replaced with secure placeholder
- Added security considerations section
- Improved installation instructions

##  Security Measures Already in Place

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- bcrypt password hashing with salt
- Role-based access control (user/admin)
- Protected routes with middleware

### File Security
- File type validation (.xls/.xlsx only)
- File size limits (10MB)
- User-specific file access
- Secure file naming convention

### Database Security
- Password exclusion in queries
- User data isolation
- Mongoose schema validation

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error middleware
- Sanitized error responses
- No sensitive data leakage

##  .gitignore Protection

The .gitignore file now protects:
- Environment files (.env, .env.*)
- Node modules and build artifacts
- Upload directory contents
- Logs and temporary files
- IDE and OS specific files
- Certificate and key files
- Database files

##  Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Change JWT_SECRET to a cryptographically secure random string
- [ ] Set strong ADMIN_PASSWORD
- [ ] Use MongoDB authentication
- [ ] Implement HTTPS
- [ ] Set up CORS policies
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security headers middleware
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular backups with encryption

##  Important Notes
1. **Change default secrets** - Update JWT_SECRET and ADMIN_PASSWORD before deployment
2. **Regular security updates** - Keep dependencies updated
3. **Monitor uploads** - The uploads directory is gitignored to prevent accidental commits

##  Immediate Actions Required

1. Generate a secure JWT_SECRET (use tools like: `openssl rand -base64 32`)
2. Set a strong ADMIN_PASSWORD
3. Review and update MongoDB connection string for production
4. Consider implementing additional security middleware (helmet, cors, rate-limiting)
